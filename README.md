# Nexlogiq AI - Enterprise Distributed Infrastructure Blueprint



An automated, enterprise-grade Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository designed to provision, harden, and optimize Linux-based Virtual Private Servers (VPS). Engineered by the **Nexlogiq AI Infrastructure Team**, this blueprint establishes a highly secure, distributed architecture that splits critical application workloads from observability stacks.

## 1. Architecture Overview

This infrastructure strictly adheres to the **NIST SP 800-207 Zero-Trust architecture** and **CIS Benchmarks** for Linux system hardening. It assumes the public internet is a hostile environment and removes reliance on traditional perimeter-only defenses.

The repository is divided into two distinct node types:

* **`core-node`**: The primary engine for databases, AI agents, and production applications (e.g., Coolify). Optimized for heavy workloads with an 8GB Swap allocation, TCP BBR network acceleration, and self-healing mechanisms.
* **`monitor-node`**: An isolated Out-of-Band (OOB) server. Connects to the core node securely via an encrypted tunnel to collect metrics without exposing telemetry to the public internet.

## 2. Core Defense & Performance Features

### Security & Auditing
* **Active Defense:** CrowdSec analyzes behavioral patterns and automatically blocks malicious IPs via `iptables`.
* **Strict Authentication:** Disables root login and password authentication entirely. Enforces SSH Key pairs combined with Google Authenticator (PAM) for mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* **System Auditing:** Uses `auditd` to act as a "black box," logging all root-level commands.
* **Integrity Monitoring:** `Monit` actively watches critical files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and alerts on unauthorized SHA1 checksum changes.

### Performance Optimization
* **Concurrency:** Raises system file descriptor limits (`fs.file-max`) to 65,535 for high-traffic handling.
* **Throughput:** Enables Google's TCP BBR algorithm to reduce latency.
* **Resource Protection:** Strict log rotation limits for Docker (max 10MB) and Systemd Journald (max 100MB) to prevent Out-Of-Space crashes.

## 3. Advanced Operational Tactics (OpSec)

This blueprint utilizes a dual-layer firewall strategy designed for extreme environments (like Oracle Cloud, AWS, or GCP).

### The "Invisible Node" Strategy
While the OS-level firewall (UFW) is configured by the script to *allow* the custom SSH port, **the Cloud Provider's Firewall (e.g., Oracle VCN Security Lists) must be configured to DROP all incoming SSH traffic from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0).**

By doing this:
1. The server becomes completely invisible to automated port scanners and botnets.
2. Administrative SSH access is **only possible** by pinging the internal Tailscale VPN IP (e.g., `100.x.x.x`).

### Emergency "Break-Glass" Procedure
In the event of a catastrophic VPN failure where Tailscale goes down globally, administrators are not locked out. The "Break-Glass" recovery process is simple:
1. Log into the Cloud Provider Console (Oracle Cloud / AWS).
2. Temporarily open the custom SSH port in the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) Security Group.
3. SSH into the server using the Public IP to resolve the VPN issue.
4. Immediately close the VCN port once the VPN is restored to return to the "Invisible" state.

## 4. Application Layer & Disaster Recovery (DR)

The `core-node` is intentionally engineered as a sterile environment, pre-optimized to host **Coolify** (an open-source, self-hosted Heroku alternative). 

### High Availability via S3
To ensure zero data loss and minimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO):
1. **Infrastructure as Code:** If a server burns down, this script reconstructs the secure OS layer in under 5 minutes.
2. **State Management:** Coolify and all containerized application databases are configured to run automated, encrypted backups to an external **S3-compatible Object Storage Bucket** (e.g., Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3).
3. **Restoration:** In a disaster scenario, spinning up a new node via this script, installing Coolify, and pulling the latest S3 snapshot restores the entire corporate infrastructure seamlessly.

## 5. Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
1. A fresh, unmodified installation of **Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04**.
2. Root (`sudo`) access to the server.
3. An active [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) account.
4. The Google Authenticator app installed on your mobile device.

### Phase 1: Preparation & Execution
1. Clone the repository to your server:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/nexlogiqai/Nexlogiq-Infrastructure.git](https://github.com/nexlogiqai/Nexlogiq-Infrastructure.git)
   cd Nexlogiq-Infrastructure
   ```

2. Edit the variables at the top of your chosen script (`core-node/provision_core.sh` or `monitor-node/provision_monitor.sh`):
   ```bash
   USER_NAME="nexlogiq_admin"
   USER_PASS="your_very_secure_password"
   SSH_PORT=2222 # Choose a non-standard port (e.g., 4422, 5022)
   ```

3. Execute the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo bash core-node/provision_core.sh
   ```

### Phase 2: Post-Deployment Initialization
**Step 1: Connect via Tailscale IP**
Ensure your VCN blocks public SSH. SSH into the server using your local Tailscale connection:
```bash
ssh -p <YOUR_CUSTOM_PORT> <USER_NAME>@<TAILSCALE_INTERNAL_IP>
```

**Step 2: Initialize the VPN (Tailscale)**
Authenticate the server to your private network:
```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

**Step 3: Setup Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Run the PAM module to secure your sessions:
```bash
google-authenticator
```
*(Answer `y` to all prompts, scan the QR code, and securely store the backup scratch codes).*

## 6. System Verification Commands

Verify the integrity of your newly provisioned node:

* **Check Firewall Rules:** `sudo ufw status verbose`
* **Check Active Threat Defense:** `sudo cscli metrics`
* **Check Monit Integrity Status:** `sudo monit status`
* **Check Docker Daemon:** `docker ps`

## Legal & Security Disclaimer

This script executes deep system modifications, alters firewall rules, disables default networking protocols (IPv6), and changes authentication mechanisms. **It is strongly advised to read the source code in its entirety before deploying it in a production environment.**

Unauthorized access to nodes provisioned utilizing this architecture is strictly prohibited. All activities are actively logged by `auditd` and monitored by `Monit`.
